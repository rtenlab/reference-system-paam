# reference_system

This package holds the core node definitions that can be used to build various reference systems that can end up being quite complex.

These _reference systems_ can then be used to benchmark, test and evaluate various changes to the core middleware being used (e.g. executors, QoS settings, DDSs', etc.).

See [autoware_reference_system](../autoware_reference_system/) as an example as to how one could use these nodes to build a simulated real-world system for benchmarking and testing purposes.
